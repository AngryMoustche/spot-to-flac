You will need to create your own "Spotify Library.txt" file. I sugest using https://www.tunemymusic.com/transfer/spotify-to-file

you may need to fix the path to that file in the begining of the script.

make sure the download doesn't fail (often after ~100 downloads) if it does just delete the already downloaded from the txt file and re-run the script.

It's nothing fancy but I figured it might help someone
